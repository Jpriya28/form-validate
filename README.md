# form-validate
Form validation is a critical component of any web application, ensuring that the data submitted by users is correct, complete, and in the expected format. A typical registration form with fields like Username, Email, Password, and Re-password requires client-side validation for an improved user experience and better data integrity.

# Purpose of Form Validation

Prevent Invalid Data Submission: Ensures that users fill out required fields correctly before submitting the form.

Improve User Experience: Provides real-time feedback and clear error messages to guide users.

Reduce Server-Side Load: By validating data on the client side, unnecessary requests to the server are avoided.

Ensure Data Integrity: Verifies that the provided data (e.g., email format, password strength) meets specific criteria.

#Key Validation Rules

**Username Validation:

Must not be empty.

Error message: "Username cannot be empty."

**Email Validation:

Must follow a valid email format (e.g., example@domain.com).

Error message: "Please enter a valid email address."

**Password Validation:

Must have a minimum length (e.g., 8 characters).

Error message: "Password must be at least  8characters long."

**Re-password Validation:

Must match the Password field.

Error message: "Passwords do not match."

**Submit Button Validation:

Remains disabled until all fields are validated successfully.
